  Thorchain
  =========
  This Kurtosis package instantiates private Thorchain testnets. It automates genesis file generation, network launching with proper seed node topology, and deployment of auxiliary services like faucets and block explorers.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Basic understanding of Thorchain and Cosmos SDK blockchain architecture
  - Knowledge of validator and node configuration parameters

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - `chains`: Configuration for each Thorchain network
    - `name`: Chain name (e.g., "thorchain")
    - `chain_id`: Unique identifier for the chain
    - `denom`: Token denomination configuration (name, display, symbol, units)
    - `participants`: Validator and node configuration
  - `services`: Additional services to deploy
    - `faucet`: Token distribution service configuration
    - `explorer`: Thorchain Explorer v2 frontend configuration
  - `network_conditions`: Latency and jitter settings for realistic testing

  Seed Node Topology
  ------------------
  The package implements the exact seed node topology as cosmos-package:
  - First node starts without any seeds (becomes the seed node)
  - All subsequent nodes connect to the first node using --p2p.seeds flag
  - This ensures proper network formation and connectivity
