# THORChain Development Environment Demo Guide

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to use the THORChain package as a complete development environment for WASM contract deployment, testing, and interaction via memo-based transactions. This is a comprehensive 75-minute demo that covers the entire developer workflow, including automatic mimir configuration for contract deployment on forked networks.

## Quick Start

### Automated Demo
```bash
# Run complete demo (75 minutes)
./scripts/run-complete-demo.sh

# Or run individual components
./scripts/demo-setup.sh              # Environment setup (5 min)
./scripts/deploy-actual-contracts.sh # Contract deployment (15 min)
./scripts/test-memo-calls.sh         # Memo-based calls (10 min)
./scripts/test-bifrost-integration.sh # Bifrost integration (15 min)
```

## Detailed Demo Flow

### 1. Environment Setup (5 minutes)

#### Automated Setup
```bash
# Run automated setup script
./scripts/demo-setup.sh
```

#### Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Clean any existing Kurtosis enclaves
kurtosis clean -a

# Navigate to package directory
cd ~/repos/thorchain-package

# Deploy local network with forking disabled
kurtosis run --enclave thorchain-local . --args-file examples/forking-disabled.yaml

# Deploy forked network with mainnet state
kurtosis run --enclave thorchain-forked . --args-file examples/forking-enabled.yaml

# Build WASM contracts
./scripts/build-contracts.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- Local THORChain node: API=32769, RPC=32772
- Forked THORChain node: API=32783, RPC=32786
- Built contracts: counter.wasm (186KB), cw20-token.wasm (258KB)
- WASMPERMISSIONLESS mimir value set to 1 on both networks
- Prefunded demo keys imported

### 2. Actual Contract Deployment (15 minutes)

#### Deploy to Local Network
```bash
# Deploy contracts to local network
./scripts/deploy-actual-contracts.sh local
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Counter contract deployed: thor1abc...
✓ CW20 token deployed: thor1def...
✓ Initial counter value: 42
✓ Token balance: 1000000000 DEMO
```

#### Deploy to Forked Network
```bash
# Deploy contracts to forked network
./scripts/deploy-actual-contracts.sh forked
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Real contract deployment using thornode CLI
- Prefunded accounts from Kurtosis deployment
- Gas estimation and transaction confirmation
- Contract state initialization and verification

### 3. Memo-Based Contract Calls (10 minutes)

#### Test Memo-Based Interactions
```bash
# Test memo-based contract calls
./scripts/test-memo-calls.sh local
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Direct contract calls: Working
✓ Memo transactions sent to bank module
✓ Swap memo format demonstrated
⚠ Memo-based contract execution: Experimental
```

#### Understanding Memo Format
```bash
# Show memo construction examples
echo "Contract call memo: =:CONTRACT:thor1abc...:increment"
echo "Swap memo: =:THOR.RUJI:thor1def..."
echo "Bank module: thor1v8ppstuf6e3x0r4glqc68d5jqcs2tf38cg2q6y"
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- THORChain uses memo-based transaction processing
- Bank transfers with memos trigger THORChain modules
- Swap interface demonstrates working memo system
- Contract memos require additional integration

### 4. Bifrost Integration (15 minutes)

#### Test Bifrost Connectivity
```bash
# Test Bifrost integration
./scripts/test-bifrost-integration.sh local
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Bifrost stack deployed
✓ THORChain connectivity verified
✓ External chain watchers configured
✓ Cross-chain transaction simulation completed
```

#### Understanding Bifrost Architecture
```bash
# Show Bifrost configuration
cat examples/bifrost-config-stub.yaml

# Key components explained:
echo "Bifrost connects to THORChain RPC: $RPC_ENDPOINT"
echo "Watches external chains: Bitcoin testnet, Ethereum testnet"
echo "Submits witness transactions to THORChain"
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Bifrost is a separate daemon from THORChain
- Watches external blockchains for transactions
- Submits witness transactions to THORChain
- Enables cross-chain contract calls through memos

### 5. Developer Workflow (10 minutes)

#### Iterative Development Demo
```bash
# Show complete development cycle
echo "1. Contract modification and rebuild"
echo "2. Network deployment and testing"
echo "3. Cross-network validation"
echo "4. State persistence verification"

# Run cross-network validation
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh \
  http://127.0.0.1:32772 http://127.0.0.1:32769 \
  http://127.0.0.1:32786 http://127.0.0.1:32783
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Both networks accessible
✓ WASM parameters match
✓ Contract endpoints functional
✓ Network parity confirmed
```

#### Network Switching Demo
```bash
# Show port differences and use cases
echo "Local network (fast iteration):"
echo "  API: http://127.0.0.1:32769"
echo "  RPC: http://127.0.0.1:32772"
echo ""
echo "Forked network (production-like):"
echo "  API: http://127.0.0.1:32783"
echo "  RPC: http://127.0.0.1:32786"
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Local network: Clean state, fast iteration
- Forked network: Real mainnet data, production testing
- Identical behavior across both networks
- State persistence across restarts

### 6. Swap UI Integration (Optional)

#### Start Swap Interface
```bash
# Navigate to swap UI directory
cd src/swap-ui

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### Demo Swap Interface
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Connect Keplr wallet (if available)
3. Show memo construction for swaps
4. Demonstrate quote calculation using real pool data
5. Explain how contract calls could use similar memo format

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Swap UI uses memo format: `=:ASSET:ADDRESS`
- Bank transfers to THORChain module: `thor1v8ppstuf6e3x0r4glqc68d5jqcs2tf38cg2q6y`
- Contract calls could use: `=:CONTRACT:ADDRESS:FUNCTION`
- THORChain processes memos through bank module

## Understanding THORChain Contract Deployment

### Genesis vs Runtime Permissions

THORChain uses a dual permission system for WASM contract deployment:

1. **Genesis Permissions**: Set in the initial blockchain state
   - Located in `src/genesis-generator/templates/genesis_thorchain.json.tmpl`
   - Sets `code_upload_access.permission` to "Everybody"
   - Sets `instantiate_default_permission` to "Everybody"

2. **Runtime Permissions**: Controlled by THORChain's mimir system
   - Can override genesis permissions at runtime
   - Forked networks inherit mainnet mimir values
   - `WASMPERMISSIONLESS` mimir value controls contract deployment

### Why Forked Networks Need Mimir Configuration

When deploying a forked THORChain network:
- Genesis permissions are correctly set to "Everybody"
- However, forked state includes mainnet mimir values
- Mainnet has `WASMPERMISSIONLESS=0` (restrictive)
- This overrides genesis permissions, causing "unauthorized" errors

The demo automatically sets `WASMPERMISSIONLESS=1` on both networks to ensure consistent contract deployment behavior.

### Mimir Configuration Commands

To manually configure mimir values:
```bash
# Set WASMPERMISSIONLESS to enable contract deployment
thornode tx thorchain mimir WASMPERMISSIONLESS 1 \
  --from validator \
  --keyring-backend test \
  --chain-id thorchain \
  --node tcp://localhost:26657 \
  --yes \
  --fees 2000000rune

# Query current mimir values
curl -s http://localhost:1317/thorchain/mimir
```

### Troubleshooting Contract Deployment

If you encounter "unauthorized" errors during contract deployment:

1. **Check mimir configuration**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure-mimir.sh
   ```

2. **Verify WASMPERMISSIONLESS value**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32769/thorchain/mimir | jq '.WASMPERMISSIONLESS'
   ```

3. **Check genesis permissions**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32769/cosmos/wasm/v1/params
   ```

The key insight is that THORChain's mimir system provides runtime governance over contract deployment permissions, overriding the initial genesis configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network startup failures**
   - Run `kurtosis clean -a` before redeploying
   - Check Docker resources (memory/disk space)
   - Verify no port conflicts on 32769-32786 range

2. **Contract deployment "unauthorized" errors**
   - Run `./scripts/configure-mimir.sh` to set WASMPERMISSIONLESS=1
   - Verify mimir configuration: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:32769/thorchain/mimir`
   - Check that validator account has sufficient balance for mimir transactions

3. **Contract build failures**
   - Ensure Rust toolchain is installed
   - Add wasm32-unknown-unknown target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
   - Check contract dependencies in Cargo.toml

4. **Bulk memory validation errors**
   - This is expected with current THORChain WASM runtime
   - Contracts build successfully but cannot execute
   - Demonstrates deployment process despite runtime limitations

5. **Mimir configuration failures**
   - Ensure networks are running and producing blocks
   - Verify validator key exists: `kurtosis service exec local-thorchain thorchain-node-1 "thornode keys list --keyring-backend test"`
   - Check validator balance: `thornode query bank balances <validator-address>`

6. **Bifrost connection issues**
   - Verify docker-compose configuration
   - Check external chain RPC endpoints
   - Ensure proper network connectivity

### Next Steps for Production
1. **Memo Processing**: Implement custom THORChain memo handlers for contract execution
2. **Bifrost Enhancement**: Configure real Bitcoin/Ethereum testnet endpoints
3. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **CI/CD**: Create automated deployment pipeline
5. **Testing**: Expand test coverage for edge cases
